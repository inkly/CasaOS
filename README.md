# CasaOS

A personal cloud for the home: a dashboard, an app store, Docker apps, files and shares on your own hardware. This repository is the core service of the **inkly distribution of CasaOS**, a maintained release of the project after upstream [IceWhaleTech/CasaOS](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS) stopped shipping in 2025.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/inkly/CasaOS-Install/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
```

One command for every supported system and architecture; the installer detects both at run time. Run it again to upgrade, or use the update button in the dashboard, which follows this distribution's releases.

**Migrating from IceWhale's or alvins82's installer** works the same way, in place, without uninstalling first. The installer stops and restarts the CasaOS services while upgrading, so back up what matters. Afterwards, `cat /var/lib/casaos/fork-release` prints the distribution release installed — `v0.4.41` for the current one. Do not use `get.casaos.io/update` after migrating: it installs IceWhale's frozen component bundle over this one.

**If the dashboard reports you are on the latest version and never offers an update**, run the install command once by hand. Up to v0.4.41, four files shipped here still carried the previous fork's release URLs, and one of them rewrote `/etc/casaos/casaos.conf` on every install, so a host installed from this distribution polled a feed whose newest release is older than what it was already running. From CasaOS-Install v0.4.42 onwards, re-running the installer corrects the configuration in place, and the update button follows this distribution on its own afterwards.

Everything the installer downloads is verified against a SHA-256 digest before extraction. What is in each release, and how a release is built, is described in [CasaOS-Install](https://github.com/inkly/CasaOS-Install#readme).

### Compatibility

Architectures: amd64, arm64, armv7.

Tested: Debian 12, Ubuntu Server 20.04 and 26.04, Raspberry Pi OS. Reported working by the community: Elementary 6.1, Armbian 22.04. Not fully tested: Alpine, OpenWrt, Arch.

Docker 24 through 29 are supported. The Docker 29 incompatibility that broke the upstream release is fixed here, without the `DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION` workaround.

### Uninstall

```sh
sudo casaos-uninstall
```

## What this distribution changes

Relative to upstream, through alvins82's fork and then here. The full list per release is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

- **Sharing** — Samba shares can be restricted to an account, managed from the dashboard and separate from the CasaOS login; shares convert between guest and account access in place. Upstream shares were world-writable, with files created as root, and Windows 10 and 11 refuse guest SMB entirely. Hosts advertise themselves over mDNS and Windows discovery without SMB1.
- **Apps** — The `docker-compose.yml` of an installed app is editable from its settings, with validation before apply. Apps open inside CasaOS or in a new tab, per app. System package updates run from the dashboard.
- **Storage** — External disks form the merged `/DATA` while the system disk stays out of it; volumes can be renamed; merge mounts are restored across reboots and slow disks.
- **Network** — The gateway serves HTTPS with a certificate you supply.
- **Security** — Routes that act as root on the host require a token even from loopback. The dashboard no longer sends a machine fingerprint to a third party, and the core no longer carries the helper and configuration entries that pointed at IceWhale's `api.casaos.io`. The install-time migration script no longer geo-locates the host either: it asked `ipconfig.io`, then `ifconfig.io`, for the country on every install and every upgrade in order to pick a download mirror. Migration tools come from GitHub; The domain is now a constant: not an environment knob either, because what it points at is downloaded and run as root without verification.
- **Updater** — Update discovery and installation follow this distribution's releases rather than IceWhale's frozen bundle, in the binary, in the shipped configuration samples, and in the setup script that writes the running host's configuration.
- **Platform** — Docker 29 and Ubuntu 26 support; every component is built and released from CI, with digests published alongside.

## Features

- A dashboard designed for the home: no forms, no configuration files to learn
- An app store with one-click installs — Nextcloud, Home Assistant, AdGuard, Jellyfin, the *arr stack and more — and any Docker image beyond it
- File management and network shares that need no technical background
- Widgets for what you care about: resource usage, app status, storage

## Community and contributing

Bug reports and requests go to [issues on this repository](https://github.com/inkly/CasaOS/issues), whichever component is involved. Pull requests are welcome on any of the component repositories under [inkly](https://github.com/inkly?tab=repositories&q=CasaOS); each has its own release workflow, and the installer pins them.

The upstream Discord, wiki and website belong to IceWhale and are not run by this distribution.

## Development

This repository builds `casaos`, the core service. Behind the gateway it serves the `/v1` API — system information and power actions, listening ports, the file manager (`/v1/file`, `/v1/folder`, `/v1/batch`, `/v1/image`), Samba shares and accounts (`/v1/samba`), cloud drivers, and status notifications from the other services (`/v1/notify`) — together with a `/v2` API generated from [`api/casaos/openapi.yaml`](api/casaos/openapi.yaml). It also polls this distribution's release feed and runs the installer when the dashboard asks for an update.

Its configuration is `/etc/casaos/casaos.conf`, created on first run from [the sample embedded in the binary](build/sysroot/etc/casaos/casaos.conf.sample). Its database and user data live under `/var/lib/casaos`, its logs under `/var/log/casaos`, and the shell helpers it shells out to under `/usr/share/casaos/shell`. The dashboard is the `UI` submodule and is built separately.

Go 1.21 or newer is the only requirement; the Go build does not need the submodule.

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build .
go test ./...
```

`TestPorts` reads the host's own listening sockets, so it fails in a container that has none.

Release packages for amd64, arm64 and armv7 are built on a tag by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), not on a workstation.

## History

CasaOS was created by IceWhale as the pre-installed system of the ZimaBoard. Upstream development moved to their proprietary ZimaOS and the open-source project stopped receiving releases in 2025. [alvins82](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS) kept it installable — Docker 29, Ubuntu 26, merged storage fixes, SMB discovery — and this distribution started from his v0.4.39 in September 2026, adding the changes above and a release process that no longer depends on a workstation.
