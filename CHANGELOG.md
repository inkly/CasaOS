# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.47] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- `FORK_RELEASE_VERSION` carries `v0.4.57`, the distribution this binary ships in. Nothing else changed; this component ships with every distribution release because that constant is the fallback the dashboard reads when `/var/lib/casaos/fork-release` is missing, and that marker holds the distribution's tag.
## [0.4.46] - ## [0.4.46] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- `FORK_RELEASE_VERSION` carries `v0.4.56`. It is the fallback the dashboard reads when `/var/lib/casaos/fork-release` is missing, and that file holds the distribution release, so the constant has to move with the distribution rather than with this component. Every distribution release ships this component for that reason; the installer stops and reinstalls every service on each run anyway, so it costs no restart that was not already happening.
## [0.4.45] - ## [0.4.45] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- The Go directive is unchanged at `go 1.21`, but the shared library it now points at brings in `orca-zhang/ecache`, whose package `init()` starts a goroutine that sleeps in a loop for the lifetime of the process. Nothing here calls the cache it backs; the goroutine exists on import alone. The leak check in `service` was taught to ignore it.
- The Go module path is now `github.com/inkly/CasaOS` and the shared library dependency is `github.com/inkly/CasaOS-Common v0.4.22`, so every log line, stack trace and `go version -m` record on the shipped binary names this distribution rather than IceWhale. Only module paths were rewritten: issue links, the App Store and release URLs, and the upstream credits are untouched, and the generated API clients are byte-identical.

### Fixed

- `FORK_RELEASE_VERSION` carries the distribution release again, not this component's own tag. It is the fallback `CurrentVersion()` returns when `/var/lib/casaos/fork-release` is missing, and that file holds the distribution tag, which is also what `version.json` announces. The two matched while the numbering coincided and had drifted since, so a box without the marker compared 0.4.44 against a feed announcing 0.4.54 and was offered an update it already had, at every poll.

## [0.4.44] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- The message-bus client is generated from this distribution's own tag (`inkly/CasaOS-MessageBus` at `v0.4.19`) instead of IceWhale's live `main` branch. `go generate` runs on every release tag, so until now a rename, a deletion or an edit upstream would have changed this binary or failed the build; the regenerated output is byte-identical.
- `.github/sync_openapi.yml` is gone. It called an unpinned reusable workflow hosted in an IceWhale repository and passed it a repository token. It sat outside `.github/workflows/`, so GitHub never ran it, but it was one `git mv` away from running.
- The install-time migration script no longer geo-locates the host. `__get_download_domain` curled `ipconfig.io/country`, falling back to `ifconfig.io/country_code`, at the top level of `build/scripts/migration/script.d/03-migrate-casaos.sh` — and `install.sh` runs every script in that directory on every install and every upgrade, so both third-party services were contacted each time regardless of whether a migration applied. Migration tools are fetched from `https://github.com/`, and the domain is a constant rather than a setting: what it points at is downloaded and run as root without verification. The migration lists are unchanged.

## [0.4.43] - 2026-09-06

### Removed

- [Config] The HTTP helper `httper.OasisGet`, which fetched a bearer token from IceWhale's `api.casaos.io` before every request it made, is gone: nothing in the codebase called it. The `ServerApi` field of the server configuration model, whose only reader was that helper, goes with it, as do the `ServerApi` and `Handshake` lines of the sample configuration that pointed at `api.casaos.io` and `socket.casaos.io`. An installed `/etc/casaos/casaos.conf` that still carries the two keys keeps working unchanged; they are simply ignored.

### Fixed

- [Notify] `go vet` reported two lock copies in the notification service: `GetList` took its receiver by value and `GetSystemTempMap` returned the `sync.Map` it holds by value, so each copied a map that embeds a mutex. Both now go through a pointer; the callers only range over the map, so nothing observable changes.

## [0.4.42] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- [Updater] The in-app updater pointed at another fork's release feed. Four shipped files still carried `alvins82/CasaOS-Install` URLs, and one of them — the setup script packaged into the installer's compatibility overlay — wrote them into `/etc/casaos/casaos.conf` on every install and upgrade, where the Go resolvers prefer them over this distribution's built-in URLs. An installed host therefore polled a feed whose latest release is older than what it was running, reported itself up to date forever, and would have fetched the other fork's `install.sh` had the update ever fired. The corrected setup script reaches a host through the installer's compatibility overlay, so existing installations need one manual re-run of the install command (`curl -fsSL https://github.com/inkly/CasaOS-Install/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash`) once CasaOS-Install v0.4.42 is published; after that the dashboard updater tracks this distribution on its own.
- [Gateway] The health check the gateway runs against its own listener retried forever instead of ten times: the countdown ran through an unsigned integer, so the last decrement wrapped around. A listener that never answered left the gateway probing it once a second for good, rather than returning the error its caller expects.

## [0.4.41] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- [Sharing] A share can be marked as a Time Machine destination. It gets Apple's SMB extensions (`vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr`, `fruit:time machine = yes`) and smbd advertises it over mDNS, so it shows up in Time Machine preferences on Macs on the network. Other shares are untouched, and a host without Samba's `vfs_fruit` module (`samba-vfs-modules` on Debian and Ubuntu) is told so instead of getting a share that refuses every connection ([CasaOS #1030](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/issues/1030)).

### Fixed

- [Logging] journald no longer receives an access-log line for the internal system-status posts CasaOS-LocalStorage sends to loopback every 5 seconds; the dashboard telemetry rate is unchanged, and remote requests to those routes, like every route outside `/v1/notify/`, are still logged ([CasaOS #2211](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/issues/2211)).
- [Dashboard] The updater panel showed the version twice over (`vv0.4.40`): `current_version` answered with the release tag, which carries its own `v`, while the dashboard adds one itself. The API now reports the bare version, as it always did upstream.

### Security

- [API] The file manager API (`/v1/file`, `/v1/folder`, `/v1/batch`, `/v1/image`) now requires a token from loopback as well: any local process, including a container on the host network, could read, write and delete files as root without one. Reported as [CasaOS #2566](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/pull/2566), whose "path traversal" framing is wrong — the paths are absolute by design — and whose sanitizer is not adopted, because confining the file manager to a fixed set of roots would break browsing `/mnt` and `/media`, i.e. every USB drive and cloud mount.

## [0.4.40] - 2026-09-04

First release of the inkly distribution, cut from alvins82's v0.4.28.

### Added

- [Sharing] Restrict a Samba share to a dedicated account. Accounts are created through the API, are separate from the CasaOS login, have no shell and cannot log in to the host. Shares convert between guest and account access in place ([CasaOS #33](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/33)).
- [Sharing] `map to guest = never` when a protected share exists, and patched in place on hosts CasaOS already configured, so a rejected login prompts for a password instead of failing silently.
- [Sharing] The generated Samba configuration is checked with `testparm` before smbd is restarted, and rolled back if rejected; a bad configuration used to take network discovery down with it ([CasaOS #33](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/33)).

### Changed

- [Build] `.goreleaser.yaml` publishes to `inkly` instead of upstream; the UI submodule follows `inkly/CasaOS-UI`; the in-app updater follows `inkly/CasaOS-Install` releases.
- [Build] Eight inherited workflows that pushed to IceWhale infrastructure or needed its secrets are removed. `codecov.yml` and `release.yml` stay.

### Fixed

- [Sharing] Share paths are confined to the data roots and resolved through symlinks before any ownership change ([CasaOS #33](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/33)).
- [Sharing] The duplicate-name check queried the path column with a basename and never matched; a second share with the same folder name silently vanished from the generated configuration.

### Security

- [API] Routes that act as root on the host — system package updates, Samba accounts, share creation — require a token even from loopback. Any local process, including a container on the host network, could reach them without one ([CasaOS #32](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/32), [CasaOS #33](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/33)).

## [0.4.28] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- [System] Use systemd's explicit `poweroff` and `reboot` targets for Dashboard power actions on systemd-based hosts ([CasaOS #26](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/26)).
- [Build] Advance the CasaOS-UI submodule to the CasaOS UI `v0.4.30` release, including the shutdown/restart flow fix ([CasaOS-UI #15](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/15)).

### Fixed

- [System] Return power-command failures from the API instead of reporting success when the host remains running ([CasaOS #26](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/26)).

## [0.4.27] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- [Sharing] Advertise CasaOS Samba hosts through mDNS/DNS-SD and Windows Web Service Discovery so macOS, Linux, and Windows clients can discover the host without SMB1 ([CasaOS #23](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/23)).

### Changed

- [Sharing] Bind Windows discovery to default-route LAN interfaces, support an optional `/etc/casaos/smb-discovery.conf` interface override, and keep discovery aligned with the `smbd` lifecycle.
- [Updater] Advance the fork release fallback to `v0.4.31` so installations without a release marker discover the current fork installer.

### Fixed

- [Sharing] Preserve administrator-managed Samba configurations and make unavailable Avahi/wsdd packages degrade to normal SMB sharing without blocking installation or upgrades.

## [0.4.26] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- [Files] Open the Files app in an App Store-style dialog on desktop while retaining edge-to-edge behavior on smaller screens ([CasaOS #21](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/21); [CasaOS-UI #11](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/11)).
- [Storage] Add storage-volume rename controls backed by the protected LocalStorage rename endpoint ([CasaOS-UI #14](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/14); [CasaOS-LocalStorage #6](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-LocalStorage/pull/6)).

### Changed

- [Dashboard] Keep the sidebar in normal document flow so the dashboard has one scroll surface and lower widgets remain reachable ([CasaOS-UI #12](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/12)).
- [Build] Update the CasaOS-UI submodule to the CasaOS UI `v0.4.29` release.

### Fixed

- [Files] Use the CasaOS icon font's `eye-outline` and `eye-off-outline` glyphs for the hidden-files toggle ([CasaOS-UI #13](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/13)).
- [Storage] Refresh filesystem labels after volume renames so Storage Manager reflects the new label immediately ([CasaOS-LocalStorage #6](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-LocalStorage/pull/6)).

## [0.4.25] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- [System] Added authenticated Debian-family system package updates in Settings, including package review, confirmation, live progress, reboot status, and completion reconciliation ([CasaOS #20](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/20); [CasaOS-UI #10](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/10)).

### Changed

- [Storage] Keep the system storage branch out of `/DATA` merged storage. External disks now provide the mergerfs branches while system AppData remains available at `/DATA/AppData`, allowing CasaOS to be installed on a flash drive without consuming it as media storage ([CasaOS #19](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/19); [CasaOS-UI #7](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/7); [CasaOS-LocalStorage #4](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-LocalStorage/pull/4)).
- [Updater] Advance the fork release fallback to `v0.4.25` so installations without a release marker still discover the current fork installer ([CasaOS #19](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/19)).
- [Build] Update the CasaOS-UI submodule to the merged system-package-update UI commit ([CasaOS #20](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/20)).
- [Docs] Record the fork UI release and related storage/app-launcher changes in the README ([CasaOS #16](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/16); [CasaOS #17](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/17); [CasaOS #18](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS/pull/18)).

### Fixed

## [0.4.21] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- [App] Open installed apps inside the CasaOS dashboard in a full-screen iframe with a close button; first-launch readiness checks remain in the current tab ([CasaOS-UI #2](https://github.com/alvins82/CasaOS-UI/pull/2)).

### Fixed

- [OneDrive] Fall back to `createdBy.user.displayName` when Microsoft Graph omits `createdBy.user.email`, and return a clear error when neither identity field is available ([CasaOS #2530](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/pull/2530)).
